-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yapping Here:

- okay so apparently i cannot declare textures in a separate header file...? 
NVM I RESOLVED THIS!!

- Render is an abstract class and objects like PlayerRender, DoorRender, PlatformRender etc will be made based off it

WORK ON LEVEL STRUCTURE FIRST!!!

- DONE WITH PAUSE/RESUME USE CASES!



WINDOW BOUNDS HAVEN'T BEEN PUT!!! Only put the right and left ones since that's the only place the player can move

player only collides with doors or PCs, not LEDs

decrease number of levels? We can't compromise use cases....
